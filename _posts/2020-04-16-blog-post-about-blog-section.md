So, you've just setup a new blog for yourself ...But now what do you do? 
How do you proceed? It's a pretty simple process, but involves a few steps; here they are all written down in one place.
                                
### 1. Step 1

Post some code stuff you've been working on or care about, for ex:

    git fetch upstream

    git checkout master

    git merge upstream/master

### 2. Make merry!

Great, now your code snippet is up, continue with next steps. 


### All done!
